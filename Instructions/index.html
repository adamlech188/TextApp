    <b>What is considered manipulating mobile device ? </b>
    <p>
        Drivers are classified into this category if they appear to be manipulating some
        type of electronic device such as a cell phone, a smart phone, PDA, video game,
        or some other device. This includes text messaging; using a Web-capable smart phone
        (such as an iPhone) or a PDA (such as a BlackBerry phone) to view travel directions,
        check e-mails or calendar appointments, or surf the Internet; manual dialing; playing
        hand-held games; and holding phones in front of their face to converse or check
        messages via speakerphone or use voice-activated dialing. Manipulation of the non-hand-
        held devices (adjusting volume on stereos, pressing but- tons on a dashboard GPS
        unit, etc.) is not included in this category.
    </p>
    <b>So what should you look for ?</b>

        <li>Drivers holding a phone in front of their face</li>
        <li>Thumbs or fingers moving on a phone</li>
